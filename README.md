# Chat

- This is a simple application which showcases the functionality of a chat.
- This application is being developed to help get familiar with the technologies used at google.

# Build instructions

- The sections that follow describe the build instructions for running a greeter which takes a `<string>` and responds with `hello <string>`

## Maven
- `mvn clean install`
- Start the server `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="edu.jyo.app.ApplicationServer"`
- Start the client GUI `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="edu.jyo.app.gui.GreeterClient"`

## Bazel
- Build the server binary `bazel build //:server`
- Build the client binary `bazel build //:greet_client`
- Start the server `bazel-bin/server`
- Start the client GUI `bazel-bin/greet_client`

### Bazel dependencies
- Bazel dependencies were generated by following the below steps
- Create a folder called `3rdparty` to host the external dependencies' descriptors.
- Create a file `dependencies.yml` listing the top level dependencies. The transitive dependencies would be generated by following the below steps.
- `git clone git@github.com:johnynek/bazel-deps.git`
- `cd bazel-deps`
- set $GRP_CHAT_PRJ to the absolute path of `grpc-chat` workspace. Run `bazel run //:parse -- generate -r $GRP_CHAT_PRJ -s 3rdparty/workspace.bzl -d dependencies.yml`
